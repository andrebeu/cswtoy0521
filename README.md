## project goal: build model to explain curriculum effect on schema  
## with Sam Gershman, Ken Norman

- Schema is implemented as transition matrix
- fit to Blocked and Interleaved curricula
- Schema inference 
  - hierarchical dirichlet-CRP assumed generative process
  - MAP point estimate on schema history
